    <h2 class="about">Who am I?:</h2>
        <p class="about">Well, that is up for debate, as I have done so many things in my life and experienced many things.
             As my CV shows, I have had many different work opportunities in various settings, which sometimes leads me to wonder what I can do as a working professional.
              I am well-adapted to be able to do any type of work, given some time to learn and gain some experience of what is expected of me.</p>
        <p class="about">I am also very good at managing, especially people, in almost all aspects of work eg. time management and vehicles.
             I have attended many workshops and seminars in management as well as leadership, as there is a big difference between the two. 
            My wish/hope/dream is find a working environment, in a forward looking country, where I can be who I am, but also to bring to the table the best of what I can do.</p>
